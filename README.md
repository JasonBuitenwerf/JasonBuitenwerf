My name's Jason Buitenwerf, I've recently completed a Computer Programming program at Algonquin College. My Studies at Algonquin were primarily concerning Java, and OOP principles in general, but I also learned about a variety of Database Topics, Web Development, and Machine learning. I'm interested in Application Development and in Web Development. I'm familiar with Java, Python, SQL (MySQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL), some NOSQL databases such as MongoDB and Neo4J, and a number of ML algorithms.
